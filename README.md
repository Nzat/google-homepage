This is my first project from The Odin Project.

The purpose of this project is to recreate the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS.

This was the first time I've done all the layout of a webpage using only CSS. It was a challenge using flexbox to position all the elements where they needed to be. Another thing that pushed me was learning the difference between margin and padding. This project was much more challenging than I initially expected.
